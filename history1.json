    "content": "You're seeing a timing discrepancy because each motor is being commanded separately. The left motor may finish its motion a moment before the right one, and when you stop them individually they brake at slightly different moments. Two solid ways to fix this are:\n\n- Strategy 1: Move with a dual-motor control (DriveBase-like) so both wheels are driven by one motion command. This keeps stopping synchronized.\n- Strategy 2: If you must drive each motor separately, issue the commands then wait until both reach their targets, and then stop both with the same brake mode.\n\nBelow are two code templates you can adapt to your environment. Use the one that fits your LEGO software (Pybricks, EV3 Python, Spike Prime Python, etc.). I’m keeping them as Python-style templates with clear placeholders you should replace for your setup.\n\nStrategy 1: synchronized dual-motor movement (recommended for synchronized stop)\n\n```python\n# Strategy 1: Use a DriveBase-like abstraction to coordinate both wheels\n# so they move and stop together. Adapt imports and constructor to your library.\n\n# Pseudo/typical API shape (adjust to your environment)\nfrom some_lego_library import Motor, DriveBase\nfrom some_lego_port import Port  # e.g., Port.D, Port.C\nfrom some_lego_time import wait_ms  # if you need a small wait\n\n# Initialize the two drive motors\nleft_motor = Motor(Port.D)\nright_motor = Motor(Port.C)\n\n# Create a DriveBase with wheel size and track width (adjust numbers)\ndrive = DriveBase(left_motor, right_motor, wheel_diameter=56, axle_track=114)\n\n# Move a specific distance (e.g., 300 mm)\ndrive.straight(300)  # or drive.go_distance(300) depending on API\n\n# Stop both motors at the same time\ndrive.stop(brake=True)  # brake=true to stop hard/similarly for both\n```\n\nNotes:\n- This uses a single command to drive both wheels, so stopping is synchronized by the drive controller.\n- If your environment uses a different DriveBase constructor or stop method, adapt accordingly.\n- You can also use a turn() command from DriveBase to rotate, and then stop with drive.stop(brake=True).\n\nStrategy 2: synchronize after separate motor commands (manual, but synchronized)\n\n```python\n# Strategy 2: Command each motor, then wait for both to reach target, then stop with same brake\n# Replace Motor, Port, and API calls with your library's equivalents.\n\nleft = Motor(Port.D)\nright = Motor(Port.C)\n\n# Define targets (in your library's units; e.g., degrees or rotations)\ntarget_degrees = 720\nspeed = 300  # choose a safe speed for your robot\n\n# Start both motors toward their targets (asynchronously if your API supports)\nleft.run_angle(speed, target_degrees, then='brake')\nright.run_angle(speed, target_degrees, then='brake')\n\n# Record starting positions to measure progress\nstart_left = left.angle()\nstart_right = right.angle()\n\n# Wait until both reach the target (adjust the logic to your API)\nwhile True:\n    left_progress = abs(left.angle() - start_left)\n    right_progress = abs(right.angle() - start_right)\n    if left_progress >= target_degrees and right_progress >= target_degrees:\n        break\n    # If you have a small wait helper, use it (e.g., wait_ms(10))\n    # wait_ms(10)\n\n# Ensure both are stopped with the same brake behavior\nleft.stop(brake=True)\nright.stop(brake=True)\n```\n\nNotes:\n- The key is to wait until both motors have reached (or exceeded) their targets, then stop them with identical brake behavior to avoid a second timing difference.\n- If your library offers a “is_busy” or “has_finished” flag for each motor, you can use that instead of polling angles.\n- Make sure you choose the same braking mode (brake, hold, or coast) for both to ensure a synchronized stop feel.\n\nTesting and debugging tips\n- Test with smaller moves first (e.g., 100 mm or 90 degrees) to verify synchronization.\n- Print or log motor angles and times during motion to observe how commands overlap.\n- If one motor consistently finishes earlier, compare motor power, friction, and wheel contact. You may need to adjust speed or add a slight delay on one side to balance.\n- Use the same brake mode for both stops (brake or hold usually yields tighter synchronization than coast).\n- Consider calibrating each motor’s effective wheel rotation (e.g., if wheels or gearing aren’t perfectly identical, you may need slightly different target values or a small offset).\n\nIf you tell me which environment you’re using (Pybricks on SPIKE Prime, LEGO EV3 Python, or another library) and the exact motor/drive objects you have, I can tailor the code with precise API calls and variable names. Also, I can provide a single, compact version if you prefer one approach over the other."
