    "content": "Great question. When motors don’t stop at the same time, it’s usually because they’re not being driven and finished in a strictly synchronized way. You want one of these approaches:\n\n- Approach 1: Start both motors together and stop when both have reached their target encoder position (synchronized, position-based stop).\n- Approach 2: Start both motors together and stop after a fixed amount of time (simple, timing-based).\n\nBelow are two viable code patterns you can adapt to your LEGO Python environment (SPIKE Prime / Pybricks style). Use the one that matches what your robot supports.\n\nOption 1: Synchronized stop using encoder targets (run in parallel, wait for both to finish)\n- Start both motors toward the same target rotation.\n- Do not wait for one to finish before starting the other.\n- Poll the motors until both have reached their targets, then brake/stop both.\n\n```python\n# Example using a Pybricks-like API (adapt port names and method names to your environment)\n\nfrom pybricks.ev3devices import Motor\nfrom pybricks.parameters import Port, Stop\nimport time\n\nleft = Motor(Port.A)\nright = Motor(Port.B)\n\ntarget_deg = 720    # how far you want to rotate (in degrees)\nspeed = 50            # motor speed (0-100, adapt to your API)\n\n# Start both motors toward the same relative target, non-blocking\nleft.run_angle(speed, target_deg, Stop.BRAKE, wait=False)\nright.run_angle(speed, target_deg, Stop.BRAKE, wait=False)\n\n# Wait until both motors have finished (speed becomes 0 or another finished condition)\nwhile left.speed() != 0 or right.speed() != 0:\n    time.sleep(0.01)\n\n# Ensure both are fully stopped\nleft.stop()\nright.stop()\n```\n\nNotes for Option 1:\n- The key is starting both in parallel (wait=False) and then busy-waiting until both are no longer moving.\n- If your API provides a direct “is_busy” or “is_running” property, you can use that instead of checking speed.\n- If the two motors have slightly different gearing or friction, you may need a tiny extra adjustment (e.g., a small compensating rotation on one motor).\n\nOption 2: Time-based stop (simple and reliable when you can’t easily read encoders)\n- Start both motors with the same speed.\n- Run for the same duration, then stop.\n\n```python\n# Simple timing-based approach (adapt to your API)\n\nfrom pybricks.ev3devices import Motor\nfrom pybricks.parameters import Port, Stop\nimport time\n\nleft = Motor(Port.A)\nright = Motor(Port.B)\n\nspeed = 50       # motor speed\nduration = 2.0     # seconds to run\n\n# Start both motors together for a fixed duration\nleft.run_time(speed, duration * 1000, Stop.BRAKE, wait=False)\nright.run_time(speed, duration * 1000, Stop.BRAKE, wait=False)\n\n# Wait for both to finish\nwhile left.speed() != 0 or right.speed() != 0:\n    time.sleep(0.01)\n\nleft.stop()\nright.stop()\n```\n\nNotes for Option 2:\n- This is straightforward but less precise because it depends on motor performance and battery level remaining similar.\n- It’s a good fallback if you don’t have reliable encoder feedback or the API doesn’t offer easy parallel waiting.\n\nQuick debugging tips:\n- Ensure both motors are aligned physically (same wheels, same gearing, same friction).\n- Calibrate so both motors start at the same time and with the same speed setting.\n- If you observe slight drift, consider a small compensation: run one motor a touch longer or at a slightly different target to compensate for mechanical differences.\n- Add a short test: run 1 rotation on both and compare actual stopping moments; adjust as needed.\n\nIf you tell me your exact environment (SPIKE Prime Python, Pybricks on EV3, or another API) and the motor ports you’re using, I can tailor the exact code names and functions to your setup."

    "content": "Nice—we can tailor this to Spike Prime Python. Here are two viable ways to synchronize two motors (A and B) so they stop at the same time. I’ll keep the logic clear and then show you Spike-friendly code blocks you can adapt to your exact API.\n\nHigh-level approach (why these work)\n- Option 1: Synchronized stop using encoder targets\n  - Start both motors toward the same rotation amount at roughly the same time.\n  - Do not wait for one motor to finish before starting the other (start in parallel).\n  - Continuously check progress and stop both when both have reached their target (or are no longer moving).\n  - Pros: Precise synchronization if encoders and friction are similar; robust to short variations in motor speed.\n  - Cons: Requires the API to give you a non-blocking start and a way to test “is still moving.”\n- Option 2: Time-based stop\n  - Start both motors together and run for a fixed duration.\n  - Stop together after that duration.\n  - Pros: Simple and robust if you can’t read encoders or don’t have precise feedback.\n  - Cons: Less precise if battery level or gearing isn’t identical between sides.\n\nCode sketches (Spike Prime Python style)\nNote: Spike Prime Python has its own API. The names below are representative patterns you’ll adapt to your exact API (motor objects, start methods, and “is_running” checks may differ). Use these as templates, then swap in your actual method names (e.g., run_for_degrees, run_for_seconds, is_running, etc.) and port labels (A/B or your chosen ports).\n\nOption 1 — Synchronized stop using encoder targets (non-blocking start, poll for completion)\n```python\n# Spike Prime Python (template; adapt to your APIs)\n# Replace with your actual motor creation and methods\n\nleft_motor = Motor('A')   # or however your Spike API constructs the motor\nright_motor = Motor('B')\n\ntarget_deg = 720    # e.g., two full rotations\nspeed = 50          # -100..100 or appropriate scale for your API\n\n# Start both motors toward the same target without blocking\nleft_motor.run_for_degrees(target_deg, speed, block=False)   # adapt name\nright_motor.run_for_degrees(target_deg, speed, block=False)  # adapt name\n\n# Wait until both motors finish\nwhile left_motor.is_running() or right_motor.is_running():\n    time.sleep(0.01)\n\n# Ensure both are stopped (brake if your API supports it)\nleft_motor.stop()\nright_motor.stop()\n```\n\nOption 2 — Time-based stop (simple, reliable when encoder feedback is unreliable)\n```python\n# Spike Prime Python (template; adapt to your APIs)\nleft_motor = Motor('A')\nright_motor = Motor('B')\n\nspeed = 50\nduration_s = 2.0  # seconds to run\n\nleft_motor.run_for_seconds(duration_s, speed, block=False)   # adapt name\nright_motor.run_for_seconds(duration_s, speed, block=False)  # adapt name\n\n# Wait for both to finish\nwhile left_motor.is_running() or right_motor.is_running():\n    time.sleep(0.01)\n\nleft_motor.stop()\nright_motor.stop()\n```\n\nKey adaptation tips\n- Port and API names: Replace Motor('A') / Motor('B') with the exact constructor your Spike Prime Python environment uses. Replace run_for_degrees / run_for_seconds / is_running with the exact method names from your library.\n- Non-blocking starts: If your API doesn’t support block=False, you can achieve parallel starts by issuing both start commands one after the other (they’ll still start close in time) and then enter a wait loop that checks some motion state or encoder values.\n- Progress checks: If you don’t have is_running(), you can implement a progress check by reading each motor’s angle/position and stopping when both have reached the target within a small tolerance.\n- Braking/stop behavior: If your API supports braking vs coasting, prefer braking to ensure motors stop promptly and in sync.\n\nTesting questions to help you iterate\n- Do both motors actually start at the same moment when you issue the start commands? If not, add a tiny synchronization delay or adjust the start sequence order.\n- Do your wheels and gears have the same load? If one side lags, you might need a small encoder-based compensation (e.g., a tiny extra degrees on one motor).\n- How consistent is your battery voltage? If you see drift across tests, consider periodic calibration or a slight speed/target adjustment per side.\n\nIf you want, tell me the exact Spike Prime Python API calls you have available (the constructor names, how you start a motor, how you check if it’s running, and how you stop). I’ll tailor the two code blocks precisely to your environment and ports, so you can copy-paste ready-to-run code."

They’re written as templates you can drop in and adapt to your exact API names (port strings, method names like run_for_degrees/run_for_seconds, is_running, etc.). They both aim to keep two motors in sync and stop at the same time.\n\nOption 1: Synchronized stop using encoder targets (non-blocking start + poll)\n- Why this works: Start both motors toward the same rotation in parallel, then continuously check when both are no longer moving and stop them together.\n- Steps:\n  1) Create motor objects for both sides.\n  2) Start both motors toward the same target rotation with non-blocking calls.\n  3) Loop and wait until both motors report they’re not running.\n  4) Stop both motors (brake if available).\n\n```python\n# Spike Prime Python - Option 1: Synchronized stop using encoder targets\n# Adapt the Motor constructor ports and the method names to your exact API.\n\nfrom spike import Motor  # adapt if your environment uses a different import\nimport time\n\n# Create motor objects (adjust ports to your hardware)\nleft_motor = Motor('A')\nright_motor = Motor('B')\n\ntarget_degrees = 720  # e.g., two full rotations\nspeed = 50            # speed scale (adjust to your API, e.g., -100..100 or 0..100)\n\n# Start both motors toward the same target in parallel (non-blocking)\nleft_motor.run_for_degrees(target_degrees, speed, block=False)   # adapt to your API\nright_motor.run_for_degrees(target_degrees, speed, block=False)  # adapt to your API\n\n# Wait until both motors finish\nwhile left_motor.is_running() or right_motor.is_running():\n    time.sleep(0.01)\n\n# Stop/brake both motors (use stop() or an equivalent)\nleft_motor.stop()\nright_motor.stop()\n```\n\nOption 2: Time-based stop (simple, robust when encoders aren’t reliable)\n- Why this works: Run both motors for an exact duration, ensuring both finish together. Good fallback if encoder feedback is noisy or unavailable.\n- Steps:\n  1) Create motor objects.\n  2) Start both motors for a fixed duration in parallel.\n  3) Wait until both report done.\n  4) Stop both motors.\n\n```python\n# Spike Prime Python - Option 2: Time-based stop\n# Adapt the Motor constructor ports and the method names to your exact API.\n\nfrom spike import Motor\nimport time\n\nleft_motor = Motor('A')\nright_motor = Motor('B')\n\nspeed = 50          # speed scale (adjust to your API)\nduration_s = 2.0    # seconds to run\n\n# Start both motors for a fixed duration (non-blocking)\nleft_motor.run_for_seconds(duration_s, speed, block=False)   # adapt to your API\nright_motor.run_for_seconds(duration_s, speed, block=False)  # adapt to your API\n\n# Wait for both to finish\nwhile left_motor.is_running() or right_motor.is_running():\n    time.sleep(0.01)\n\nleft_motor.stop()\nright_motor.stop()\n```\n\nAdaptation tips (important):\n- Port and API names: Replace Motor('A') / Motor('B') with your actual port identifiers. Replace run_for_degrees/run_for_seconds/is_running/stop with the exact methods your Spike Prime Python library provides.\n- Non-blocking starts: If your API doesn’t support a block=False flag, you can still start both motors one after the other and then poll is_running() in a loop.\n- Progress checks: If you don’t have is_running(), you can track progress by reading each motor’s angle/position and stopping when both have reached a target within a small tolerance.\n- Braking vs coasting: If your API supports a braking option, use it (stop()) to ensure tighter synchronization on stop.\n\nTesting and debugging steps:\n- Do a small test first (e.g., 360 degrees) to verify both sides start close in time and stop together.\n- Check physical factors: wheel diameter, gearing, and friction. If one side tends to lag, you may need a tiny encoder-based compensation (e.g., target_deg + a small offset on one motor).\n- Confirm battery level effects: test at different battery levels to see if drift appears; you may need to adjust speed or add a tiny per-side offset.\n\nIf you share the exact Spike Prime Python API you’re using (the import names, the exact method names for starting motion, and how you read motor state), I can tailor these blocks to be copy-paste-ready for your setup."
